## Getting started
The application is written in Ruby on Rails, download the repository and run the `bin/setup` script to get started. It requires [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

## Tests
The application uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) for all tests, they are run with the command `rspec`.

## Deployment
The application can easily be deployed to e.g. [Heroku](https://heroku.com). The `master`-branch is automatically deployed to a Heroku-instance controlled by the authors.

## History
The development of Röstsytem started in the end of 2015, [Jakob](https://github.com/navro) did the first development and was then assisted by [David](https://github.com/davidwessman). The system have been used at several general meetings at [F-sektionen](https://fsektionen.se) and also some times at other organisations at LTH in Lund.

It was forked by [Johan](https://github.com/JohanWinther) for use at Fysikteknologsektionen at Chalmers from the end of 2017 and forward.
